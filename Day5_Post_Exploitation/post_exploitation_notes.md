# Day 5 – Post-Exploitation

## Simulated Shell
- Simulated access to Metasploitable shell as if exploitation succeeded

## 🔍 Information Gathered
- `/etc/passwd` listed all users
- Found potential config files with passwords in `/var/www/html`
- `.bash_history` contained old commands run by user

## 🌐 System & Network
- Kernel: Linux 2.6.24-16-server
- IP: 192.168.56.102
- Running services: FTP (21), SSH (22), Apache (80)

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Even without root, attackers can find sensitive data
- Web apps often leak credentials or clues
- Post-exploitation is about pivoting: use findings to plan next moves
